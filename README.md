## How to apply for a grant

To apply for a grant from Only Dust, please follow these steps:

1. Review the criteria evaluated by the committee, which includes the impact on the ecosystem, onboarding of new users, feasibility, and alignment with the ecosystem strategy.

The impact on the ecosystem refers to how your project will benefit the Starknet ecosystem. Your project should have a clear and measurable impact on the ecosystem, such as improving network performance or increasing user adoption for example.

Onboarding of new users refers to how easy it is for new users to use your project. Your project should have a clear presentation, as well as documentation, guides, and tutorials for new users.

Feasibility refers to how achievable your project is within the given budget and timeline. Your project should have a clear and realistic timeline, as well as a budget breakdown that shows how the funds will be used.

Alignment with the ecosystem strategy refers to how your project fits within the Starknet ecosystem strategy. Your project should align with the long-term goals of the ecosystem, such as improving scalability or enabling new use cases.

2. Fill out the application form, which can be found here: [insert link to the form here].

The application form asks for information such as your contact information, project description, project timeline, budget requested, and other relevant information.

3. Wait for the committee to review your application. Grants are allocated monthly, and need to be renewed.

## How to renew a grant

If you have previously received a grant from Only Dust and would like to renew your grant, please follow these steps:

1. Fill out the renewal form, which can be found here: [insert link to the form here].

The renewal form asks for information such as your contact information, project progression, budget consumption, new budget request, what you will use the budget for, and other relevant information.

## How the committee proceeds

## Decisions

The decisions made by the Starknet builders committee are stored in the [`decisions`](/decisions) directory of this repository. Each decision is saved as a separate markdown file and includes the list of projects that were reviewed, the budget allocation, and any other relevant information about the decision.
